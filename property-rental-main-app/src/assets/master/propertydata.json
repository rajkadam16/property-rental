    "propertyNeighborhood": "Chicago’s reputation as one of America’s most distinctive cities owes a lot to the electric atmosphere and vibrant culture that defines Downtown Chicago. Iconic sites like Grant Park, Soldier Field, the Chicago Theatre, Navy Pier, and the Chicago Riverwalk are the most famous landmarks in Downtown, but that barely scratches the surface of what the neighborhood has to offer: dozens of theaters, live music venues, museums, and galleries fill the area, along with hundreds of shops and restaurants catering to every conceivable taste, plus the campuses of Columbia College Chicago, DePaul University, and the Art Institute of Chicago.The Loop, Greektown, River North, and the Magnificent Mile are all nearby, easily reached by a short ride on the train. There’s no shortage of swanky apartments and condos in Downtown Chicago, but you can often find great deals on studios as well, allowing you to live in the heart of the action even if you’re on a budget.",
